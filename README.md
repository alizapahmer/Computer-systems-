Implemented a basic weather page- by collecting a user's Latitude and Longitude and retrieving the weather from an existing weather API,
displaying the results in a human readable way.
Created a client-host connection using HTTP GET to retrieve the data
and implemented a command line utility that connects to the client via the network to perform this request.
